## Omics analysis for cultured and stimulated microglia 

> This repository includes code and plots for the analysis of organoid triplicates at the accute timepoint. We test for differential gene expression between CTR and LPS conditions.


1. Base QC
- [LPS MIA base QC](https://ar-kie.github.io/LPS-MIA/docs/LPS-MIA-base.html). Organizing meta- and countdata with follow-up base QC steps. 


2. OH1.5A
- [LPS MIA OH1.5A](https://ar-kie.github.io/LPS-MIA/docs/LPS-MIA-OH1.5A.html). Analyzing the data of cell line OH1.5, batch 1.


3. OH1.5B
- [LPS MIA OH1.5B](https://ar-kie.github.io/LPS-MIA/docs/LPS-MIA-OH1.5B.html). Analyzing the data of cell line OH1.5, batch 2.

4. OH2.6

- [LPS MIA OH2.6](https://ar-kie.github.io/LPS-MIA/docs/LPS-MIA-OH2.6.html). Analyzing the data of cell line OH2.6.


5. PRO1
- [LPS MIA PRO1](https://ar-kie.github.io/LPS-MIA/docs/LPS-MIA-PRO1.html). Analyzing the data of cell line PRO1.

6. Accute all samples
- [LPS MIA accute](https://ar-kie.github.io/LPS-MIA/docs/LPS-MIA-accute.html). Analyzing the data of cell line PRO1.
